> [!IMPORTANT]
> EShot supports KDE Plasma 6 Wayland and GNOME Wayland. KDE Plasma is the primary tested Linux target, while GNOME support is stable for normal use but has received less broad real-world testing. Other desktop environments and compositors remain unsupported and are unlikely to work correctly.

EShot keeps the complete screenshot workflow in one compact tray application: select a region, annotate it, copy or save it, extract text, search the image, upload it, pin it above other windows, or record it as GIF/MP4.

## Capture workflow

Start a capture from the tray icon, `Print Screen`, a custom global shortcut, a direct-action shortcut, or the command line. Select a region and use the overlay toolbar to annotate, OCR, search, upload, pin, copy, save, or begin recording.

Double-clicking a screen during selection captures that complete monitor. The overlay adapts to tight spaces and scaled multi-monitor layouts.

## Install

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Benoks/EShot/releases/latest).

### Windows

1. Download `EShot_Setup_v<version>_x64.exe` or the ARM64 installer.
2. Run the installer and choose the optional FFmpeg/OCR components you need.
3. Launch EShot from the Start menu or system tray.

Portable x64 and ARM64 ZIP archives are also attached to each release.

### Linux: KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME Wayland

KDE Plasma 6 Wayland and GNOME Wayland are supported Linux targets. KDE Plasma is the primary tested environment. GNOME is stable for normal use, although its wider real-world testing coverage is still smaller. As with any Wayland desktop, portal versions can affect capture, shortcuts, tray integration, and recording behavior.

1. Download `EShot-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage`.
2. Mark it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x EShot-v*-x86_64.AppImage
   ```

3. Start it from a terminal:

   ```bash
   ./EShot-v*-x86_64.AppImage
   ```

   KDE Plasma commonly offers a graphical launch flow after the file is executable. Stock GNOME Files does not register AppImages as applications, so double-clicking can show an "open with" prompt instead of starting EShot. Running the two commands above is the reliable first-launch method on GNOME. AppImageLauncher, when installed by the user, can provide double-click integration.

4. Complete the graphical first-run wizard. It can install FFmpeg/GStreamer, PipeWire portal components, Tesseract, selected OCR languages, and optional application-menu integration through the system package manager.
5. Use **Use Print Screen for EShot** to assign `Print Screen`. KDE keeps Spectacle's other shortcuts. GNOME uses the Global Shortcuts portal when available and an EShot-only custom shortcut on older GNOME releases.

#### AppImage first launch and integration

The AppImage is portable. Opening it does not install EShot system-wide. The Welcome screen appears only on the first launch; completing or skipping the optional setup marks it complete, so it does not return on later launches.

When **Add EShot to the application menu and install shortcuts** is selected, the setup copies the AppImage to `~/.local/opt/EShot/EShot.AppImage`, creates an application-menu entry, and restarts from that managed copy after successful setup. Launch EShot from the application menu after that point. The original file in Downloads remains a separate portable copy and can be removed once the menu entry works. If the option is not selected, nothing is copied and you continue launching the same AppImage manually.

The AppImage bundles EShot and Qt. Optional media, OCR, and desktop-integration packages remain system packages. Skipped dependencies can be installed later from **Settings → Open Linux dependency setup**. A native package such as the AUR package is the smoother option for users who want an ordinary application-menu entry and package-manager updates.

Each release also includes `EShot-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` for users who prefer an unpacked build. Unlike the AppImage, this archive relies on compatible Qt and runtime libraries installed by the Linux distribution.

Integrated AppImages are stored for the current user under `~/.local/opt/EShot`. EShot checks for updates and always keeps manual updating available. If an EShot-managed Windows installation or integrated AppImage is at least two stable releases behind, EShot downloads the matching release asset, verifies its GitHub SHA-256 digest, updates silently, and restarts. Native package builds should be updated through their package manager.

### Arch Linux and CachyOS

Install the EShot-maintained AUR binary package with an AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S eshot-bin
```

The package installs the release AppImage and its desktop entry through pacman. Update it with your normal AUR helper rather than EShot's AppImage updater.

### Linux runtime notes

- Wayland screenshots and recordings use XDG Desktop Portal and PipeWire.
- KDE global shortcuts use KGlobalAccel. GNOME uses the Global Shortcuts portal where available and can install an EShot-only GNOME custom shortcut as a compatibility fallback.
- Stock GNOME does not expose legacy tray icons. When no tray integration is available, launching EShot from the application list opens a compact control window with Capture, Settings, About, and Quit. Autostart remains silent. `Print Screen` and custom shortcuts continue to work independently of the tray.
- GNOME screenshots are delivered through its secure Screenshot portal. EShot warms that service at startup, but the portal still adds a short delay before the selection panel appears. This varies by GNOME and portal version and is expected on Wayland.
- GNOME and KDE Wayland use an XWayland selection overlay so text entry, focus, and one-canvas multi-monitor selection behave consistently.
- GIF recording uses GStreamer for portal capture and FFmpeg for final GIF encoding.
- MP4 recording requires a GStreamer AAC encoder when audio is enabled.
- Screen recording permission is handled by the desktop portal. EShot stores a separate restore token per monitor when the portal supports persistent sessions.
- A recorded region must fit inside one monitor. If the portal opens a monitor chooser, select the monitor containing the region.
- The optional dependency setup uses the PackageKit session installer when the desktop provides it, then falls back to the native pacman, apt or dnf workflow.

## Visual search

Choose **Google Lens** or **Yandex Images** in Settings. EShot uploads only the selected region to a temporary public image host and opens the chosen visual-search provider with that temporary URL.

Do not use visual search for private or sensitive screenshots.

## OCR

OCR is powered by Tesseract. The first-run wizard can install English, the system language, and additional language data. Missing languages remain visible but disabled so the missing dependency is clear. The OCR result dialog can copy recognized text or open it in Google Translate. Translation opens the browser and does not send OCR text through an EShot translation service.

## Upload services

Anonymous providers work without credentials. Google Drive and Yandex Disk require OAuth access tokens; Allwebs and Radikal Cloud require service API keys. OAuth tokens are stored in the operating system credential store, never in EShot's plain-text settings file.

### Google Drive token setup

1. Open [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground).
2. Select the Drive API v3 scope:

   ```text
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
   ```

3. Authorize the scope and exchange the authorization code for tokens.
4. Copy the `access_token`, or copy the complete JSON response.
5. Paste it into EShot's Google Drive token field.

OAuth Playground access tokens expire. Generate a new token if an upload later returns HTTP 401.

## Default shortcuts

Most shortcuts can be changed in Settings.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Print Screen` | Start region capture |
| Double-click a screen | Capture the complete monitor |
| `Enter` / `Ctrl+C` | Copy selection |

| `B` | Blur |
| `N` | Counter |
| `X` | Eraser |
| `D` | Semi-transparent rectangle |
| `I` | Eyedropper |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Undo / redo |
